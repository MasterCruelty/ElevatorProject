# ElevatorProject
A project I made some years ago to accomplish the exam of Computer Architecture 1 at University of Milan.
The relation is written in Italian only.

### How to run
the project was made by using Logisim. If the version pushed here doesn't work anymore, you can download the software [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/circuit/).

### Here below a few images of the circuits of the project.
#### This bunch of multiplexers is used to "draw" the characters on the LED matrix. This one draws the number "1"

#### This circuit manages how many people are in the same moment on the elevator.

#### All these multiplexers just draw "ERR" on the LED matrix.
